## Personal Motivation and Dataset Choice

I chose the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Index dataset because of my strong interest
in cultural and historical contexts, particularly how societies have viewed and treated
women over time. As a personal interest, I enjoy learning about different cultures and
examining how historical norms and belief systems may continue to influence modern
social outcomes.

A few months ago, I began watching the television series *Vikings*, which portrays women
in Scandinavian societies as respected members of their communities who held influence,
participated in decision-making and had a visible voice in social and political life.
This depiction stood in contrast to many other European societies of the same historical period
period, which are often described as more “advanced” but offer women significantly
fewer rights and protections.

This observation led me to reflect on the role of pre-Christian belief systems, such as
various forms of paganism, in shaping social norms around gender. In several historical
contexts, including Norse pagan societies and traditions associated with Tengrism,
women appear to have held comparatively higher levels of social agency and respect.
While these belief systems were diverse and evolved over time, they often emphasized
balance, communal responsibility, and the complementary roles of men and women.

These reflections prompted me to question whether deeply rooted cultural traditions and
worldviews influence how modern institutions and legal frameworks related to gender
equality are formed and applied. Culture alone does not determine outcomes, and modern
gender equality is strongly shaped by laws, education systems, and economic structures.
However, cultural values may interact with these institutions by shaping social trust,
norms, and expectations.

In the modern world, laws formally define gender equality, but culture still plays an
important role in how those laws are interpreted, enforced, and experienced in everyday
life. This dataset allowed me to explore these ideas at a global scale and consider
whether countries with different cultural, religious, and historical backgrounds show
meaningful differences in women’s peace and security outcomes.
