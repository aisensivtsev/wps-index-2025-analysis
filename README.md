## Data Source: Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Index 2025/26

The dataset used in this analysis comes from the **Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Index 2025/26**, produced by the **Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security (GIWPS)** in collaboration with the **Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO)**, with support from the Government of Norway.

The WPS Index evaluates and ranks **181 countries** based on women’s overall wellbeing. Scores range from **0 (worst)** to **1 (best)** and are calculated using **13 indicators** that span three core dimensions:

Each row in the dataset represents a single country, and each column represents either an overall index score, a rank, or one of the component indicators used to compute the final score.

According to the 2025/26 Index, **Denmark ranks highest globally**, while **Afghanistan ranks lowest**, highlighting persistent global inequalities in women’s status. The report notes that global progress on women’s rights has stalled in recent years, though improvements have occurred in some conflict-affected countries.

The WPS Index is designed to support evidence-based policymaking, track trends over time, and hold governments accountable for commitments to advance women’s rights and security.
